## Motivation

The motivation behind Ambie is to build a simple but beautiful soothing sounds player for Windows. Animations are used to enhance the experience. Only a few UI elements are available in the app. This is on purpose because for Ambie, _less is more_.

## Translation

Ambie needs volunteer translators! To help translate, follow these instructions.

### Adding a new language (requires Visual Studio 2019)
- Create a new issue with the subject `[Translation] fr-CA` where you replace `fr-CA` with whatever language-region code you'll be translating into.
    - If an issue already exists, then don't do this step.
- Fork and clone this repo
- Open in VS 2019
- In the `AmbientSounds.Uwp` project, find the `Strings` folder.
- Create a new folder inside `Strings` that looks like this: `en-US` but using the language you're translating into.
- Add a new `Resources.resw` item in that new folder
- Copy all the existing data from `Strings > en-US` into your new `Resources.resw`
- Translate the strings from english to your language
- Once done, then commit > push > create pull request!

### Improving an existing language (can be done with any text editor)
- Fork and clone this repo
- Open the the `.resw` file (e.g. `en-US > Resources.resw`) you want to edit. Choose any text editor
- Translate
- Commit > push > create pull request!
