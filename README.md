## Motivation

The motivation behind Ambie is to build a simple but beautiful soothing sounds player for Windows. Animations are used to enhance the experience. Only a few UI elements are available in the app. This is on purpose because for Ambie, _less is more_.

## Contributors

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep in mind the motivation behind Ambie, however: _Less is more_. New sounds are greatly appreciated. New sounds must
- Have a license that can work with Ambie
- Have an image
- Have attributions for sound and image
